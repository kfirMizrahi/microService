# Microservices Project

This project demonstrates a basic microservices architecture with a user service and a todo service, each running as separate Flask applications. The frontend is a React application that interacts with these services.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Node.js and npm

### Backend Setup

1. **User Service**

   Navigate to the `user-service` directory:

   ```bash
   cd user-service
   ```

   Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install flask flask_sqlalchemy
   ```

   Run the user service:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The user service will be running on `http://127.0.0.1:5001`.

2. **Todo Service**

   Navigate to the `todo-service` directory:

   ```bash
   cd ../todo-service
   ```

   Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install flask flask_sqlalchemy
   ```

   Run the todo service:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The todo service will be running on `http://127.0.0.1:5002`.

### Frontend Setup

Navigate to the `microservices-ui` directory:

```bash
cd ../microservices-ui
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the React application:

```bash
npm start
```

The React application will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Ensure Services are Running

To ensure the Flask services are running without manually starting them each time, you can use tools like `pm2` or create background processes. Here’s a simple way using `pm2`:

1. Install `pm2` globally:

   ```bash
   npm install -g pm2
   ```

2. Start the services with `pm2`:

   ```bash
   pm2 start user-service/app.py --name user-service
   pm2 start todo-service/app.py --name todo-service
   ```

3. List running processes:

   ```bash
   pm2 ls
   ```

4. To stop the services:

   ```bash
   pm2 stop user-service
   pm2 stop todo-service
   ```

5. To restart the services:

   ```bash
   pm2 restart user-service
   pm2 restart todo-service
   ```

## Project Details

### Backend

- **User Service**

  Provides endpoints to create and fetch users. Uses Flask and SQLAlchemy for the ORM.

- **Todo Service**

  Provides endpoints to create and fetch todos based on user IDs. Uses Flask and SQLAlchemy for the ORM.

### Frontend

- **UserComponent**

  Component to create users and list existing users. Utilizes Axios for making API requests.

- **TodoComponent**

  Component to create todos for a user and list todos for a given user ID. Utilizes Axios for making API requests.

### Animations and Styling

- Uses `styled-components` for styling React components.
- Uses `react-transition-group` for animations.
- CSS for animations is defined in `animations.css`.

## Additional Notes

- Make sure to update the API endpoints in the frontend components if the backend services are running on different URLs.
- Customize the styles and animations as per your requirements.
